##### Contributors: Aric Landy, John Landy, John Stefan

### Introduction
This project uses linear algebra and simple but effective machine learning concepts in order to recognize traffic signs. 

### Key Concepts
Using the span of several images for each sign, our project calculates the minimum error of projection onto the span of each different image in the database. 

Added functionality of this project works in basic machine learning conepts by adding images to the database as they are categorized. This will allow the program to grow more accurate as it takes in more input
